# Project Name 
MessageLite
# Description
    MessageLite is a message app built with python3. It utilizes python socket 
    to enable connections between clients. main_server.py is the server which 
    receives information from clients and forwards information to clients. 
    main_client.py is user client which handles user inputs. User not only can
    do basic navigations between tabs locally, but also can send messages and 
    pictures to selected users. Images are encoded/decoded using base64
    encoding/decoding so the images are in a string format and could be 
    transferred between server and clients. A speech to text feature can convert user's speech to text. This feature utilizes Google Speech API. It records 
    user's speech and sends the speech to Google for speech recognition, and 
    Google sends back a string of recognized text.
    GUI mainly utilizes tkinter. It takes user's inputs including key press,
    mouse press, mouse release, mouse hover and mouse wheel, and trigger actions
    accordingly. Actions include modifying objects on the main screen and 
    sending/receiving information to/from the server. The screen will refresh(redraw) constantly to update the objects displayed on the screen.
